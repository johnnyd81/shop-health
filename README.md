# Health Store App

This app enables a user to purchase exercise equipment and health supplements. The user can select products on the catalogue page and keep track of the selected items by clicking the cart link that updates the cart contents in real time. The cart also monitors the cost of all the products added to the cart. The user can increase or decrease the quantity amount of each item or remove the item completely by deleting it from the cart. Each modification to the products in the cart is reflected in the total cost of the cart in the user interface. Details of the cart contents are stored in sessionstorage of the browser. The application was built using HTML, CSS and javaScript.
